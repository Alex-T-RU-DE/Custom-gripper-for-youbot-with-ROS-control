# Kuka-gripper-ROS-Serial-Arduino

This project shows how to make and implement a new gripper for the arm of the Kuka Youbot.

Models with printing:

Electrical parts:

Codes and controller:

Instructions for the service:

Step by step for starting the programm:

Before starting make sure that you installed Arduino IDE.

1. Copy folder "youbot_gripper" into your scr directory.
2. Compile it with catkin_make.
3. installing ROSserial:
    'sudo apt-get install ros-<your_version_of_ros>-rosserial-arduino'
    'sudo apt-get install ros-<your_version_of_ros>-rosserial'
4. Open <your Arduino directory>/Arduino/library in terminal and run following command:
    'rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py'  (It will automatically prepare and copy all your custom messages, services and packages (including youbot gripper) in the library of Arduino.
5. Download file "Gripper_service_server.ino" and put it into Arduino directory.
6. Firsly, try to compile it. If it works just go to the step 7. If not and you are having following error:
' #include <cstring>
          ^~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated. '  you should  chang the  "**msg.h**" in `~/Arduino/libraries/ros_lib/ros`  destination generated by `rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .` with "**msg.h**" file from "*rosserial lib*" (0.7.8 version) which could be downloaded from the Library manager of Arduino IDE (directory of this file in downloaded library: `~/Rosserial_Arduino_Library/src/ros/`).
