# Custom gripper for youbot with ROS control 

Language: [English](https://github.com/Alex-T-RU-DE/Custom-gripper-for-youbot-with-ROS-control/blob/main/README.md), [Русский](https://github.com/Alex-T-RU-DE/Custom-gripper-for-youbot-with-ROS-control/blob/main/README.ru.md) 

This project shows and explains how to make and implement a new gripper with ROS connection for the arm of the Kuka Youbot. 

## Required parts

-   Two servos 
-   Printed with 3D printer and assembled gripper from the following [link](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4764063)
-   Arduino mega/[pro](https://www.amazon.de/ARCELI-Arduino-Mega-ATmega2560-CH340G-Elektronik/dp/B07MQ1J9MR/ref=sr_1_13?dchild=1&keywords=arduino+pro&qid=1613692717&sr=8-13) 
-   Wires
-   [DC-DC transformer](https://www.amazon.de/LAOMAO-Wandler-einstellbar-Spannungswandler-Converter/dp/B00HV4EPG8/ref=asc_df_B00HV4EPG8/?tag=googshopde-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=231941675984&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=3852759402861473550&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9068552&hvtargid=pla-420005320986&psc=1&th=1&psc=1)


## Software:

Before starting, make sure that you installed Arduino IDE.

1. Copy folder "youbot_gripper" into your catkin_ws/src directory.

2. Navigate yourself into catking_ws download and compile folder "Youbot gripper" with catkin_make.

3. installing ROSserial:
 ```
sudo apt-get install ros-<your_ros_version>-rosserial-arduino
sudo apt-get install ros-<your_ros_version>-rosserial
 ```
4. Open <your Arduino directory>/Arduino/library in a terminal and run the following command:
```
rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .
```
It will automatically prepare and copy all your custom messages, services, and packages (including youbot gripper) in the library of Arduino.

5. Download file "Gripper_service_server.ino" and put it into Arduino directory.

6. Firstly, try to compile it. If it works - upload the program to your Arduino board and go to step 7. If not and you have the following error:

```
#include <cstring>
    ^~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated. 
 ```
you should change the "**msg.h**" in `~/Arduino/libraries/ros_lib/ros` destination generated by ```rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .``` with "**msg.h**" file from "*rosserial lib*" (0.7.8 version) which could be downloaded from the Library manager of Arduino IDE (directory of this file in downloaded library: `~/Rosserial_Arduino_Library/src/ros/`).  

   
7. To start your gipper, you should start following command on your device, which is connected to the gripper:
```
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/tty_YOUR_PORT_FOR_ARDUINO 
```
example:  
```
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0
```
This command will start the server on your Arduino device, and it will share the service for gripping. You could play with this service by starting a simple client with the following command:
```
rosrun youbot_gripper youbot_gripper_client NUMBER_OF_INSTRUCTIONS 
```
Where ```NUMBER_OF_INSTRUCTIONS``` should be replaced according to numbers, which listed below
        
                                 
## Instructions for the service

To use different commands for this gripper, you could use the following numbers to achieve the desired result:

```0``` - close gripper

```1``` - open gripper

```1000-1380``` set the angle of the first servo to the position in range 0-380

```2000-2380``` set the angle of the second servo to the position in range 0-380



### Simulation:
 coming soon
 
### Integration with the Youbot arm in Gazebo:

Working demo: https://youtu.be/vPzOUe2N2ss

If you already have youbot package, for the implementation of this gripper with its functionality to the Kuka youbot Gazebo simulation, you have to do following actions:

1. Copy File `gripper_controller.launch` and put it into your `~catkin_ws/scr/youbot_simulation/youbot_gazebo_control/launch` directory
2. Copy files `gripper_controller.yaml` and `gripper_controller_1.yaml` into your `~catkin_ws/scr/youbot_simulation/youbot_gazebo_control/config` directory
3. Replace your `~catkin_ws/scr/youbot_description/urdf/youbot_gripper` and `~catkin_ws/scr/youbot_description/meshes/youbot_gripper` folders with the same folders from the same directories from this repository.

or you can simply download `youbot_descriptions` and `youbot_simulation` folders into you `catkin_ws`.

after you did this changes you should start the simulation with the following command:

```roslaunch youbot_gazebo_robot youbot.launch``` 

Sometimes, simulation require 2 or 3 restarts to spanw robot and controllers correcrly.
If your simulation works well, you can check the fingers of the gripper with:

```
rostopic pub -1 /gripper/gripper_controller_1/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: -1.5" 
rostopic pub -1 /gripper/gripper_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 1.5"
```
